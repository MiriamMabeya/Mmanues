Our research found Burns in the third spot of Scotland’s favourite Scots poems, too! A Red, Red Rose could perhaps be considered the most romantic of Burns’ poems and is said to have been written for his wife, Jean Armour.

In the poem, Burns declares the intense love he feels for his wife and compares his love for her to be like a rose, insisting that his love will last forever. The poem suggests that the narrator might be going through a separation from his love, and concludes the poem by insisting that his love for her will persist even when they are apart:

“And I will come again, my luve, Though it were ten thousand mile.”
